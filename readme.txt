story|ftw is a full screen, mobile first storytelling plugin. It can do text, images, gifs, video backgrounds plus a whole lot more.

[story|ftw](http://storyftw.com/) extends the publishing power of your WordPress theme. Allows you to easily tell full screen — no header, footer, or menu — stories with a rich range of content and style elements.
